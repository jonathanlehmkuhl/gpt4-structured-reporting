<tr><td bgcolor="#ababab">Free Text</td><td style="white-space: word-wrap;", bgcolor="#ededed">CLINICAL HISTORY: Evaluation for pancreatic cancer.TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast, arterial phase, and venous phase contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained using a multidetector CT scanner. Multiplanar reformations were also reviewed.FINDINGS: Pancreatic tumor: There is a 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm hypodense mass in the pancreatic head, which demonstrates mild heterogeneous enhancement on arterial and venous phases. The mass causes mild upstream dilation of the pancreatic duct, measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. There is no pancreatic parenchymal atrophy.Metastatic disease: Multiple liver lesions are identified, the largest being in segment VIII, measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm, with arterial enhancement and washout on the venous phase, consistent with metastatic deposits. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is observed. There are enlarged peripancreatic, porta hepatis, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.8 x 1.3 cm. No pelvic or retrocrural lymphadenopathy is detected. No suspicious lung nodules or pleural effusions are noted.Vascular involvement: The pancreatic mass encases the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and partially compresses it, with less than 50% narrowing of the vessel lumen. The main portal vein, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are patent and not encased by the tumor. No signs of cavernous transformation are observed.Thrombosis: No thrombus is identified within the portal vein, SMV, splenic vein, or inferior vena cava (IVC).Anatomy: The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys demonstrate normal size, shape, and enhancement pattern. No renal or ureteral calculi are detected. The gallbladder, appendix, and bowel loops are unremarkable. No free fluid or air is observed in the abdominal or pelvic cavities.IMPRESSION: Hypodense mass in the pancreatic head, measuring 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm, consistent with a pancreatic neoplasm. Multiple liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease. Enlarged peripancreatic, porta hepatis, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, suggestive of lymph node metastases. Partial encasement and compression of the superior mesenteric vein by the pancreatic mass, without thrombosis. No other vascular involvement or thrombosis identified.

The multiparametric prostate MRI was performed to monitor the known prostate cancer. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, including diffusion, T2, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging of the prostate. The post-contrast images were obtained following the uneventful intravenous administration of 8 mL of gadobutrol (Gadavist) gadolinium-containing contrast. COMPARISON: ( )FINDINGS: The prostate gland is mildly enlarged measuring 4.2 x 4.8 x 4.7 cm (volume 42 mL). There are no suspicious lesions or abnormal signal intensity in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. However, a small focal area of low T2 signal intensity is seen in the right transition zone measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter, which has increased in size compared to the prior study. The area shows restricted diffusion on the ADC map, with a value of 912 x 10^-3 mm^2/s. In addition, there is a focal area of T2 hypointensity in the left base peripheral zone, measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter, which has remained stable. The ADC value for this area is 1235 x 10^-3 mm^2/s. The dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) characteristics show diffusely enhancing area with plateau-type kinetics in the right transition zone, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 4. On the other hand, the left base peripheral zone has mildly enhancing area with gradual wash-in and washout kinetics, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 3. IMPRESSION: Based on the above findings, there is no evidence of suspicious lesions or significant changes in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland compared to the prior study. However, the small focal area of low T2 signal intensity in the right transition zone has increased in size compared to the prior study, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 4. This suggests a possible progression of the previously diagnosed prostate cancer in the right transition zone, requiring further evaluation and monitoring.

FINDINGS: The pulmonary arteries demonstrate a filling defect in the right lower lobe segmental branch, consistent with a pulmonary embolism. No additional filling defects are identified in the remaining pulmonary vasculature. The thoracic aorta is unremarkable without aneurysmal dilatation or dissection. Mild bronchial wall thickening is present in the left lower lobe, likely due to bronchitis. The lung parenchyma is otherwise clear, with no nodules, masses, or significant infiltrates identified. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is observed. The heart, pericardium, great vessels, and mediastinum appear normal. No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is detected. The tracheobronchial tree is patent and unremarkable. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals no significant abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe segmental branch. Immediate clinical attention and management are recommended.

<tr><td bgcolor="#ababab">Free Text</td><td style="white-space: word-wrap;", bgcolor="#ededed">HISTORY: The patient is a 53-year-old female presenting with right shoulder pain, with a request to evaluate for synovitis. COMPARISON: No prior studies are available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: A 3T MRI of the right shoulder was performed, including axial, coronal, and sagittal sequences with proton density fat saturation and T1- and T2-weighted images. FINDINGS: The MRI reveals minimal degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint. There is a small amount of fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa and a moderate-sized glenohumeral joint effusion with synovitis. Mild bursal-sided fraying and tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon are seen, with punctate T2 hyperintensity at its insertion but no discrete tear. Mild tendinopathy of the subscapularis tendon is also noted. The remainder of the rotator cuff appears unremarkable. The intra-articular biceps tendon demonstrates minimal tendinopathy, while the extra-articular biceps tendon appears normal in location and appearance. A small paralabral cyst is adjacent to the anterosuperior labrum, measuring 5 x 3 x 2 mm, with associated tearing and partial detachment of the anterior and anteroinferior labrum. Mild degeneration of the posterior labrum is present as well. Mild subchondral cystic changes are seen in the anteroinferior glenoid, and minimal cystic change of the humeral head insertion of the interest in this tendon is observed. Linear signal subjacent to the superior humeral head cartilage, measuring 13 x 8 mm, is consistent with cartilage delamination. Cartilage thinning is also noted over the anteroinferior glenoid. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified, and muscle bulk and signal intensity appear within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Tearing and partial detachment of the anterior and inferior labrum with an adjacent small paralabral cyst. Cartilage delamination over the superior humeral head.

<tr><td bgcolor="#ababab">Free Text</td><td style="white-space: word-wrap;", bgcolor="#ededed">MR ELBOW:  __.CLINICAL HISTORY: Left wrist pain. Technique: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the left wrist, including coronal, sagittal, and axial T1 images, and coronal, sagittal, and axial STIR images. FINDINGS: The MRI demonstrates no definite osseous signal abnormality within the carpal bones. The bones are well aligned, and the articular surfaces are smooth. However, there is subtle bone marrow edema involving the scaphoid and lunate bones, which is best seen on the STIR images. There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or subluxation. The scapholunate ligament appears mildly thickened and demonstrates increased signal intensity on STIR images, suggesting a possible partial tear.

PROCEDURE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the left hip was performed at 3T before and after the uneventful administration of IV gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: Extensive intra and extra-articular signal abnormality, consistent with the patient&#x27;s history of PVNS. The abnormality originates from the right hip and extends into the ischiofemoral interval. It invades the proximal anterior compartment of the thigh anteriorly, infiltrates the adductors and obturator externus muscles medially, and extends into the gluteal musculature posteriorly. Laterally, the PVNS wraps around the posterior greater trochanter. The posterior margin of the PVNS is adjacent to the right ischial tuberosity and abuts the sciatic nerve without causing abnormal nerve signal. At the level of the ischiofemoral interval, the PVNS spans an area of approximately 17.4 x 13.8 x 9.6 cm (SI x transverse x AP), indicating a slight increase in size since the previous examination. There is bony involvement of the femoral head and neck, lesser trochanter, and acetabulum. Cortical erosion is present, which can be seen more clearly on the comparison radiograph.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen/pelvis from __ PROCEDURE: The patient underwent a multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the abdomen and pelvis on a 3 Tesla magnet without intravenous contrast due to compromised renal function. FINDINGS: Upon reviewing the lung bases, no pleural or pericardial effusions were observed. The liver appeared normal in size and contour, but with two T2 hyperintense lesions in the left hepatic lobe. The largest lesion was found in segment 2, measuring 2.8 x 2.5 cm, consistent with metastatic disease. The biliary tree showed no signs of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, and the common bile duct measured up to 4 mm in diameter. The gallbladder seemed unremarkable with no signs of wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or cholelithiasis. The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys showed no significant abnormalities. The spleen was unremarkable in size, shape, and signal intensity without any focal lesions. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava were within normal limits, with no evidence of aneurysm or dissection. The mesenteric vasculature appeared patent and unremarkable. No significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy was identified. The small bowel loops appeared normal without evidence of obstruction, dilation, or wall thickening. The large bowel demonstrated no focal abnormalities, and the anastomotic site from the prior sigmoid colectomy appeared intact and unremarkable.

<tr><td bgcolor="#ababab">Free Text</td><td style="white-space: word-wrap;", bgcolor="#ededed">EXAM: MRI NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL INDICATION: The patient presents with left-sided neck discomfort and a newly noticed swelling in the left neck region. TECHNIQUE: The MRI examination was performed using coronal T1 and T2-weighted sequences, sagittal T1 and T2-weighted sequences, and axial T2 sequences, without intravenous contrast administration. No prior studies are available for comparison. FINDINGS: A skin marker is located on the left side of the neck at the level of the C5/6 intervertebral disc space. The cervical spine alignment appears normal. Vertebral bodies demonstrate preserved signal and height. Intervertebral disc spaces exhibit normal height, with moderate disc desiccation at C5/6 and C6/7 levels. There are mild disc-osteophyte complexes present at C5/6 and C6/7. Facet joints appear normal, and no spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is observed. The visualized spinal cord and posterior fossa display normal signal and contour, with no evidence of intra- or extradural mass lesions. A heterogeneous T1 and T2 hyperintense mass is identified in the left anterior cervical space, adjacent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mass measures approximately 2.8 x 1.8 x 4.2 cm in AP, lateral, and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively. The mass shows a predominantly fluid signal, suggesting a possible cystic lesion. Further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may be considered to clarify the nature of the lesion and rule out any solid components, which could indicate neoplasia or inflammation. The remaining cervical soft tissues appear normal. IMPRESSION: A 2.8 x 1.8 x 4.2 cm predominantly fluid-filled mass in the left anterior cervical space, possibly representing a cystic lesion. Given the patient&#x27;s left-sided neck discomfort, further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may be considered to characterize the lesion and exclude any solid component suggestive of neoplasia or inflammation.</td></tr>

Evaluation for possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is requested. TECHNIQUE: 3 Tesla MRI scanner. The study includes cine imaging in standard long-axis and short-axis views, T2-weighted imaging, T2* imaging, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences, and volumetric quantification measurements. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy with a maximal wall thickness of 18 mm in the basal anteroseptal segment. The left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved at approximately 55%. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function. Mild aortic regurgitation is observed, and the other valves appear normal. No significant pericardial effusion is identified. Late gadolinium enhancement reveals patchy mid-myocardial enhancement in the hypertrophied septal segments, suggestive of myocardial fibrosis. T2-weighted images show no signs of myocardial edema or inflammation. T2* imaging reveals a myocardial T2* value of 32 milliseconds, indicating no significant myocardial iron overload. The atria are normal in size, and no intracardiac thrombus is detected. Volumetric Measurements: Patient weight/height: 92 kg, 180 cm, BSA 2.18 m^2 RVEDV: 156 mL, 72 mL/m^2 RVESV: 68 mL, 31 mL/m^2 RVSV: 88 mL, 40 mL/m^2 RVEF: 56 % LVEDV: 193 mL, 89 mL/m^2 LVESV: 87 mL, 40 mL/m^2 LVSV: 106 mL, 49 mL/m^2 LVEF: 55 % IMPRESSION: Asymmetric septal hypertrophy with maximal wall thickness of 18 mm in the basal anteroseptal segment, consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction at 55%. Patchy mid-myocardial enhancement in the hypertrophied septal segments, suggestive of myocardial fibrosis. Mild aortic regurgitation and no significant pericardial effusion. No evidence of significant myocardial iron overload based on T2* value.</td></tr>
